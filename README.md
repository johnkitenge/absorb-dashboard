Absorb is a non-profit education and training project that aims to bring high-quality educational content to underserved communities through third-party learning platforms like Udemy and Udacity.
Absorb is currently working on launching its pilot program with 50 students and is looking to have an average of 500 applicants before selecting the 50.
What Absorb needs is a platform in which applicants can fill in a short form and upload their CV so that they could be vetted in preparation for a callback. 
Note 
All applicants whether they passed or failed will be saved onto a database.
 the form which the users fill in once they fill in this form a generic application number is created that way they can eventually update it in the future or can use that number as reference when contacting the administrator.
This will also be used by a recruiting firm and so there should be php version 
The dashboard should have a simple design to navigate as there isn't a large amount of functionality this is where admins can go through the backlog of applicants
